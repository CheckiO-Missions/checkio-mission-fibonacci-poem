            üí° Be attentive - this mission is not very easy, so as solution. The general idea is to make an iterator with separate words from the given <b class="code">text</b>. Then on each step take a needed number (current Fibonacci number) of words, until the iterator become exhausted. On each step join words in a line and join all lines into multiline text at the end.

        Ok, what should I start from?

            Before writing the function, you need to import <b class="code">Iterator</b> object from <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html">collections.abc</a> module.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
from collections.abc import Iterator        
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now, split the given <b class="code">text</b> into sequence of separate words with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp">str.split()</a> method with default separator and create an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp">iterator</a> from the sequence.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
it = iter(text.split())

        Clear! What to do next?

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Let's imagine what you will have at the end. You will need an additional function (e.g. <b class="code">gen</b>), which takes the iterator <b class="code">it</b> as argument and returns all joined lines with the correct number of words. So, your general function should return these lines joined with new line symbol. Use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_join.asp">str.join()</a> method with <b class="code">\n</b> as separator. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def gen(it: Iterator[str]) -> Iterator[str]:
    ...
it = iter(text.split())        
return "\n".join(gen(it))
        </pre>
        <p>Your function <b class="code">gen</b> will yields joined lines of words, so the return type is also <b class="code">Iterator</b>. Now, you need to write the function.</p>

        Let's do it! What should be there?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You need to declare two variables with the starting elements of Fibonacci progression to be able to calculate any of its further elements. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
f0, f1 = 0, 1
        </pre>
        <p>
            You don't know, how long you are going to receive words from <b class="code">it</b>, so you need <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp">while True</a> loop here.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">

    ...

        How to create each line of words?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Let's break this step into a few ones. Obviously, words in the line are joined together with white space.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
line = " ".join(...)
        </pre>
        <p>
            What should you join inside? You need to take the next element from <b class="code">it</b> again and again. If the iterator become exhausted, you need to take "_". This is written very short.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
line = " ".join(next(it, "_") ...)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Well, how many words should you get each time? Since you don't need empty lines, you should start from <b class="code">f1</b> words, which is equal <b class="code">1</b> now. Iterate over <b class="code">f1</b> items with now assigning to variable.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
line = " ".join(next(it, "_") for _ in range(f1))
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Wow! That was short and smart! What shall I do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            In some moment, when there are no words left, you will get the line, which already starts from "_". So now you need to check each line and break the loop in this case. You may use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_startswith.asp">str.startswith()</a> method with argument <b class="code">_</b>.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
if line.startswith("_"):
    break

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I see. How to proceed the loop if the line still includes words?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            As I said before, your <b class="code">gen</b> function is a generator itself, so now you should <a target="_blank" href="https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/">yield</a> your correct line out of function.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
yield line
        </pre>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        No I need to get a new Fibonacci number?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Yes! The only thing left is to create a new <b class="code">fo, f1</b> to use them to get bigger number of words from <b class="code">it</b> later. Python makes this double assignment easy.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
f0, f1 = f1, f0 + f1

        So, how my final solution should look like?

            You just need to join all hints and wrap your code into function expression. Using type hints for input and output data are highly recommended.

            This one is generally the same, but with list slicing instead of yielding values from iterators.

        <div class="spoiler">

def fibo_poem(text: str) -> str:

    a, b, text, poem = 0, 1, text.split(), []
    while text:
        row, text = text[:b], text[b:]
        row.extend('_' * (b - len(row)))

        a, b = b, a + b
    return '\n'.join(poem)

        <p>
            This one is even shorter. Revert the list with words and pop items from the end until the list is noe empty, then take "_". Then build new Fibonacci numbers and update string result with new joined line. Strip all unnecessary white spaces and new line symbol.
